    <h5>Declaring variables in Javascript</h5>
    <p>It is possible to declare a variable with 3 different keywords. Each keyword has a correct use. There is:
        <ul>
            <li><code>let</code></li>
            <li><code>const</code></li>
            <li><code>var</code></li>
        </ul>
        let is used when assigning a variable that might change value in the future.
        <br>
        const is used when assigning a variable that only needs to be initialized once.
        <br>
        var is a nogo, when assigning variables since it doesnt care about scope, and that is something that we dont want to work with
    </p>

    <h5>Datatypes in Javascript</h5>
    <p>Javascript as a language is not type strong. Which means you dont have to declare a type,
         the same way you would in Java etc. It's types are also dynamic, meaning the same variable can store different types of data:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">let someVariable; //here someVariable is undefined
            someVariable = "Andreas"; // her someVariable is a Number
            someVariable = 5; // here someVariable is a String
            const groceries = ["Milk", "Eggs", "CatFood"]; // here groceries is an Array
            const groceries = {numberOfItems: 10, priceTotal: 250, priceAvg: 25}; // here groceries is an Object</code> 
    </pre>

    <h5>Hoisting</h5>
    <p>Hoisting is a principle of declarations getting moved to the top of the current scope, before execution of the code. Either to the top of scope inside of a method, 
        if the variable is declared there, or to the top of the scope in the entire script
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">x = 5;
        console.log(x); //This will still print, even though the x is first declared on the line below, because of hoisting
        let x;
        </code> 
    </pre>
    
    <h5>Functions in Javascript</h5>
    <p>Functions are "variables" with a functionality, and is a great tool to avoid duplicating code.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN){
            //This is the functionality of the function, and can be whatever you desire
        }</code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Callback functions in Javascript</h5>
    <p>A callback function, like the name somewhat implies, is a function getting called after a priveous function is finished executing. 
        This is very useful in javascript, as javascript is asyncronoush, and doesnt wait until something is done running before running the next thing.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">setTimeout((1000), () => {
            console.log("Hello World"); //Here the console.log doesn't print before the timeout method is finished
          }, timeout); </code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Arrays in Javascript</h5>
    <p>An array in javascript is a collection of either simple datatypes like strings or int, sorted by an 0-index. 
        Arrays can also store objects. And in either case have a lot of different useful methods connected to it.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">const arrayOfSimpleDatatypes = ["Andreas", 2, true, 10.5, undefined];
        const ArrayOfObjects = [
        { Name: "Andreas", Age: 24, Nationality: "Danish" },
        { Name: "RandomName", Age: 0, Nationality: undefined }
        ];
        
        const groceries = ["cucumber", "tomato", "potato"]; // declaring a new array array
        groceries.push("steak") // add a steak element to the array
        groceries.pop(); // removes the last item of an array
        groceries.shift(); // removes the first element and "moves" all other elements to a lower index 1 lower than they were before
        groceries.lenght(); // returns the length of the array
        groceries.splice(1,2,"fish","chicken") // The first parameter refers to the index of the array, the second to how many items needs to be replaced, 
        // and the third is the actual elements replacing
        //The splice method also returns the removed items</code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Loops in Javascript</h5>
    <p>It is possible to use loops in javascript <code>for and while</code>, but nowadays loops is getting outdate, they're slower and more errorprone.
    It is therefore recommended to use the array methods instead, which is quicker and more functional</p>
    <p>Loops should only be used when the intention is to iterate through each object</p>
    <p>While loop</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">while (condition) {
            // code block to be executed
          }</code>
    </pre>
    <p>forEach loop</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
            let text = "";
            for (let x in numbers) {
              text += numbers[x];
            }</code>
    </pre>

    


    <h5>Spread operator</h5>
    <p>The spread operator in Javascript has the syntax of 3 dots (...), and it allows us copy all or only part of an array or an object into another object or array
    </p>
    <p>In the example below the spread operator is used in the HTTP patch method, since we aren't necessarrily updating everything in the specific object</p>
    
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">app.patch("/fruits/:id", (req, res) => {
            const foundFruitIndex = fruits.findIndex(fruit => fruit.id === Number(req.params.id));
            if (foundFruitIndex !== -1) {
                const Fruit = fruits[foundFruitIndex];
                const fruitToUpdateWith = { ...foundFruit, ...req.body, id: foundFruit.id };
                fruits[foundFruitIndex] = fruitToUpdateWith;
                res.send({ data: fruitToUpdateWith });
            } else {
                res.status(404).send({});
            }</code>
    </pre>
