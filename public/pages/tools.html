    <h1>Tools</h1>

    <h5>Node</h5>
    <p>Node is a runtime enviroment basen on javascript, but can run on a server</p>
    <p>There are a few command associated with node which are import </p>
    <p><code>node -v</code> which tells what version of node you're running</p>

    <p><code>node <FILE_YOU_WANT_TO_RUN></code> this command runs the selected file once</p>
    <h5>Package.json</h5>
    <p>This JSON file is located in the root of your project. It contains the metadata of your project. The package.json
        file is also our
        buildtool, in which we can declare scripts to run. It is also used to declare the dependencies needed in that
        specific project.
        If you're running an express project you need to declare that there.
    </p>

    <h5>NPM (Node Package Manager)</h5>
    <p>npm is used to install different packages into your node project. Using the command <code>npm i</code> followed
        by the package you need,
        in our case <code>express</code>, and it will be installed right in your package.json dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>In some cases it will be nicer to install something globally on your computer, rather than in the different
        projects.
        Thats the case with <code>Nodemon</code>, in which you instead use the command
        <code>npm install -g nodemon</code> (-g for global)
    </p>
    <h5>Nodemon</h5>
    <p>Nodemon is a package used as a developer tool, since it can reload your node project after every change made.
        This is a great tool, since
        you only have to type <code>nodemon <FILE_TO_RUN></code> instead of running <code>node <FILE_TO_RUN></code>
        everytime a change is commited.</p>
    <p>If you want to customise what nodemon listens on, you can create a nodemon.json file at the root of your project.
        Here you specify the
        file extension in which you want changes listened to.
    </p>
    <h5>Express</h5>

    <p>Express is a node web application framework, which helps you build a backend for a fullstack application using
        node and express.</p>
    <p>Before getting started with express make sure you've downloaded npm and node.</p>
    <p>To install express you need an empty node project, in which you create a file called package.json. In here simply
        put <code>{ }</code>
        and run the command <code>npm i express</code></p>

        <p>Express will then be installed and you can then create your first express project</p>

        <p>This is an example of a simple web application using express</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers">
            <code class="language-javascript">const express = require("express"); //This imports express via the require keyword
                const app = express(); //This initializes express and saves it as an variable called app, which can then later be used
                
                //Create an endpoint with app.get
                app.get("/", (req, res) =>{
                    res.send("Hello World");    //Send a string to the web application
                })
                
                //Open the server on a port of your choosing
                app.listen(3000, () =>{ 
                    console.log("Server is running on port ", 3000);
                });</code>
        </pre>

    <h5>fs</h5>
    <p>fs stands for file system and is used to read from and write to files.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-javascript">const fs = require("fs"); // import fs via require
            const nav = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/nav.html").toString(); // use fs to read the nav.html file</code>
    </pre>
    <h5>Heroku</h5>
    <p>Heroku is a cloud platform used to deploy all kind of web applications. It is free to use and easy to deploy unto.</p>
    <p>Before use, navigate to the heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up">site</a>, 
        and download their CLI. This will allow you to deploy on their site, with a few tweaks to your code and a couple of terminal commands.</p>

        <p>The first thing you need to do is add a script into your package.json file:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers">
            <code class="language-javascript">"scripts": {
                "start": "node <FILE_TO_RUN>"
            }</code>
            </pre> 

            <p>The next step is to change the port your application listens to, so change app.listen in app.js to the following</p>

            
            <pre class="line-numbers">
                <code class="language-javascript">app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function(){
                    console.log("Express server listening on port %d in %s mode", this.address().port, app.settings.env);
                });</code>
                </pre> 

                <p>This was the tweaks needed in your code, now make sure your project is pushed so youre up to date</p>

                <p>Run the command <code>heroku create</code> to create the heroku app, and push your github repo to it <code>git push heroku main</code></p>
                <p>If the project is a subfolder on your github app run the following command instead <code>git subtree push --prefix <PATH_TO_SUBFOLDER_PROJECT> heroku master</code></p>
                    <p>If you need to take your project down from heroku again simply run the following:</p>
                    <code>git remote rm heroku</code>
                    <code>heroku git:remote -a <NAME_OF_APP></code>
